# Archaeological Site Detection: From Papers to Datasets

A complete pipeline for extracting archaeological site information from academic papers and generating multi-channel remote sensing datasets for machine learning-based site detection.

---

## Overview

This repository combines two complementary workflows designed to support reinforcement learning and deep learning approaches to archaeological site discovery:

1. **Site Extraction Pipeline** - Extract archaeological site coordinates from academic PDFs using LLMs
2. **Dataset Generation Pipeline** - Generate multi-channel satellite imagery datasets from known site locations

**Project Origins:** This work was developed as part of our participation in the [OpenAI to Z Challenge on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-to-z-challenge/overview), where we explored AI-powered archaeological discovery in the Amazon. Our competition writeup detailing the approach is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/openai-to-z-challenge/writeups/bostonlistener_digitalarchaeology). The pipeline has since evolved into a comprehensive framework for digitizing archaeological knowledge and preparing it for machine learning applications. Our approach was presented at [CAA UK 2025](https://uk.caa-international.org/caa-uk-2025/) (Computer Applications and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology) held at the University of Cambridge, December 9-10, 2025.

## Dataset

A pre-generated dataset created using this pipeline is available on Hugging Face:

**🤗 [Archaeological Sites Dataset (CAA UK 2025)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lldbrett/archaeological-sites-caa2025)**

The dataset provides multi-channel remote sensing data (Sentinel-2 + FABDEM + spectral indices) with balanced positive/negative samples and augmentations for training archaeological site detection models.

---

## Pipeline Independence

**Important:** Each step works as a standalone tool - you can use either one independently or combine them for the full workflow.

### Use Step 1 Alone
- Digitize archaeological site data from legacy publications
- Extract coordinates and metadata from PDFs
- Download satellite imagery for specific sites
- Export site databases for GIS or other applications
- **No need to install Step 2 dependencies**

### Use Step 2 Alone
- Generate training datasets from your own fieldwork coordinates
- Process site data from existing databases or catalogs
- Create balanced ML datasets from any site coordinate source
- **No need to install Step 1 dependencies or OpenAI API**

### Use Both Together
- Complete end-to-end pipeline from literature to ML-ready datasets
- Seamless data handoff between extraction and generation
- Ideal for comprehensive archaeological ML projects

## Key Features

### Step 1: Site Extraction
- 📄 **PDF text extraction** from archaeological publications
- 🤖 **LLM-powered analysis** (GPT-4o) to identify sites and coordinates
- 🗺️ **Multiple coordinate format support** (DMS, decimal degrees, etc.)
- 🛰️ **Satellite data download** for extracted sites (Sentinel-2 + terrain)
- 🌐 **Web interface** for easy interaction

### Step 2: Dataset Generation
- 🎯 **Balanced dataset creation** with positives, negatives, and unlabeled samples
- 🔄 **Geometric augmentation** via rotation (configurable: 3x, 4x, 6x, 12x)
- 🌈 **Radiometric augmentation** for lighting/contrast variation
- 📊 **11-channel data** (6 spectral bands + 3 indices + elevation + slope)
- 📦 **Production-ready format** with metadata and validation tools

---

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**For Step 1 Only:**
- Python 3.7+
- OpenAI API key ([get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
- Google Earth Engine account ([sign up here](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/))
- Modern web browser

**For Step 2 Only:**
- Python 3.7+
- Google Earth Engine account ([sign up here](https://earthengine.google.com/signup/))

**For Both Steps:**
- All of the above

**Python Dependencies:**
```bash
# Install for Step 1 only
cd 1_site_extraction
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install for Step 2 only
cd 2_dataset_generation
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Or install for both if using full pipeline
```

### End-to-End Workflow

#### Step 1: Extract Sites from Papers

```bash
cd 1_site_extraction

# Set up environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OpenAI API key and GEE project ID

# Place GEE service account JSON
cp ~/Downloads/your-gee-key.json ./gee_service_account.json

# Start web interface
python app.py
# Open http://localhost:5000
```

**What you'll do:**
1. Upload archaeological paper PDFs
2. Let GPT-4o extract site information
3. Review extracted sites with coordinates
4. Download satellite data for each site (optional)
5. Export site list as JSON

**See detailed instructions:** [1_site_extraction/README.md](1_site_extraction/README.md)

---

#### Transition: Convert JSON to CSV

Step 1 outputs JSON format, but Step 2 requires CSV input. Create `known_sites.csv`:

```csv
site_id,latitude,longitude,site_type
site_001,-9.8765,-67.5346,geoglyph
site_002,-10.1234,-68.4567,mound
site_003,-11.2345,-69.5678,settlement
```

Extract from your Step 1 JSON output:
- `site_id`: Unique identifier
- `latitude`: Decimal degrees (negative for S)
- `longitude`: Decimal degrees (negative for W)
- `site_type`: Optional classification

---

#### Step 2: Generate Training Dataset

```bash
cd 2_dataset_generation

# Prepare input
mkdir -p inputs
cp /path/to/known_sites.csv inputs/

# Configure pipeline
cp config/settings.yaml.example config/settings.yaml
# Edit settings.yaml with your GEE project ID and parameters

# Authenticate GEE
earthengine authenticate

# Run full pipeline
python run_pipeline.py
```

**What this generates:**
- Multi-angle views of each site (rotation augmentation)
- Integrated negatives from surrounding landscape
- Diverse landcover negatives (urban, water, cropland)
- Unlabeled background samples
- Radiometric augmentations (brightness/contrast/noise)

**Output:** `outputs/dataset/` with:
- `grid_metadata.parquet` - Master metadata table
- `grid_images/` - Individual 100×100×11 samples as NumPy arrays
- Ready for PyTorch/TensorFlow training

**See detailed instructions:** [2_dataset_generation/README.md](2_dataset_generation/README.md)
